## The problem
World Bank Offers a vast catalogue of data that is vital for research and facilitating prosperity across the globe.

While it is important to analyze the data and draw conclusions from it, many online tools don't empower users to  create change without the right tools or extensive knowledge of data research

## Solution
To bridge this gap in the industry, GiveWithInsite  is a solution that makes data actionable by enabling its users to view information around the world and donate to foundations based on data insights

## What it does
GiveWithInsite is a tool that works with the Data Bank API to access critical information on international data

Our website brings this information right to you in a neat format so you can analyze it and also make decisions based on the data without sifting through heaps of information.

As a result, you are able to identify which locations are in most need of certain resources and we'll help you find organizations that work locally to help address those needs

## Inspiration
Many can agree that its difficult to make use of the excess resources in our lives like unused clothes or school supplies

However, it's challenging to liberate ourselves from these materials when we don't know where they should go

So we match you with organizations based on what you have to offer and on the data measured from countries that are in need of these resources

# How to Run

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
